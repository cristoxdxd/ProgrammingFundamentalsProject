# Programming Fundamentals Project
This repository contains my project of Programming Fundamentals in C languaje.

For this proyect your group have to build a program with the following features:  

 1. Calculator  
    * Sum
    * Substraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division
    * Power
    * Square root  

2. If-else exercises
    * The greater of three numbers
    * Class exercises (at least three)

3. While exercises
    * The sum of n number, the average, and the standard deviation.
    * Given n, show thw multiply tables

4. For exercises
    * Write a program that displays all nonempty subsets of the set of numbers 1 through n.  
    For example, if n = 3, it should be obtained:
    ```C
    Nonempty subsets of 3 are:
        1
        2
        3
       1 2
       1 3
       2 3
      1 2 3
    ```
    * Write a program that print a diamond with '*' given a number.

> **NOTE:** The program would be iterative, in other words, the user could navigate between menus and submenus   

**_Remember:_** your menus would be iterative if you use the following format
```C
do{
    switch (navegator){
        case 1:
        case 2:
        ·
        ·
        ·
        case n:
    }
}while(menu_operator == 0);
break;
```
